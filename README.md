# Odoo API Python script

### Odoo Integration - Retrieve Product List

This Python script connects to an Odoo instance and
retrieves a list of products using Odoo RPC.

##### Requirements for execution

- Local server to connect. Replace host and port names.
- A database to login and fetch data. Replace db name, user and password names. 

####  Challenges
At first, it was a little complex in my mind to understand Odoo API, but I managed to understand it.
With a step-by-step guidance from the API documentation I created the necessary classes and function for the integration and the fetch of the data, but I had a little problem trying to connect with a local server.
In this case I didn't manage to test any demo Odoo instance and fetch data.
The most important thing is that I got to know Odoo API and its potentials and learned how to use API to connect to a server, database and interact with varius data.
